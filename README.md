<h1 align="center">Haideron-LMS</h1>

i thought of working on the OBE problem for my uni, tried to push through it, but let’s just say any future addition is abandoned and the project’s stuck at a stalemate forever.  

<p align="center">
  A <strong>scalable, modern outcome-based Learning Management System (LMS)</strong> built for institutions that value performance, reliability, and ease of use.  
  Designed with <strong>Node.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL (via Drizzle ORM)</strong>, and <strong>Redis (for the social layer)</strong>
